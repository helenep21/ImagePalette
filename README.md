# ImagePalette

The goal of this program is to take an image and get the most used colors in it.

The run.bat file is used to launch it, but if you've never launched it before, you 
should start by the first_launch.bat file to make sure every modules needed is installed.

When you run it, a window will open to select an image, and then another window to 
chose where to export it.

In the folder results, you can see what the final image will look like with the
main colors added under it.
